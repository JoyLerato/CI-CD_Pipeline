CI/CD Pipeline Project
Overview
This project demonstrates the setup of a CI/CD pipeline using Eclipse, GitHub, Jenkins, and AWS EC2. The pipeline automates the integration and deployment of a web application, ensuring efficient development cycles and secure hosting on AWS EC2.

Features
Continuous Integration: Automates the build and testing of the application whenever new code is pushed to the GitHub repository.
Continuous Deployment: Automatically deploys the application to AWS EC2 after successful builds, ensuring rapid and reliable deployment.
GitHub Integration: Source code management and version control using GitHub, facilitating collaboration and code review.
AWS EC2 Deployment: Hosts the deployed web application on AWS EC2 instances, utilizing cloud infrastructure for scalability and reliability.
Requirements
Eclipse IDE
GitHub account
Jenkins CI/CD server
AWS EC2 (or virtual machine) for deployment
Setup Instructions
Eclipse Setup:

Install Eclipse IDE and necessary plugins for Java development (if applicable).
Configure Git plugin in Eclipse for GitHub repository interaction.
GitHub Repository Setup:

Create a new repository on GitHub to host your project.
Initialize the repository with a README and .gitignore file to exclude sensitive files (e.g., credentials).
Jenkins Setup:

Install Jenkins on a local server or virtual machine.
Configure Jenkins with necessary plugins for GitHub integration and AWS EC2 management.
Configure Jenkins Pipeline:

Create a Jenkins pipeline project to automate the CI/CD process.
Configure pipeline stages for build, test, and deploy, integrating with your GitHub repository.
AWS EC2 Deployment:

Set up AWS EC2 instances for hosting the deployed application.
Securely configure access credentials and permissions for Jenkins to deploy artifacts to EC2.
Documentation:

Document tracked files that are ignored during final GitHub pushes for security reasons.
Provide Jenkins pipeline configuration details and AWS EC2 setup instructions.
Usage
Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
Make code changes and push commits to the repository.
Jenkins will automatically trigger builds and deployments based on changes pushed to GitHub.
